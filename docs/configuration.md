# Configuration

This page documents the current V3 configuration for `pi-observational-memory`.

V3 keeps the existing `observational-memory` settings namespace, but the setting names changed. Old V2 keys are not aliases; they are ignored. If you are upgrading, read [Migrating from V2](#migrating-from-v2).

## Where settings live

Pi reads settings from:

1. Global settings: `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
2. Project settings: `<project>/.pi/settings.json`
3. Environment override: `PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE`

Project settings override global settings. `PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE` overrides only `passive` when set to a recognized value.

All extension-owned settings live under:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {}
}
```

The extension loads config once for its runtime. After changing settings, restart Pi or reload the extension so the new values are picked up.

## Full V3 example

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observeAfterTokens": 10000,
    "reflectAfterTokens": 20000,
    "observerChunkMaxTokens": 60000,
    "compactAfterTokens": 81000,
    "observationsPoolMaxTokens": 20000,
    "observationsPoolTargetTokens": 10000,
    "agentMaxTurns": 16,
    "model": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "id": "google/gemma-4-31b-it",
      "thinking": "low"
    },
    "showWorkerNotifications": true,
    "passive": false,
    "debugLog": false
  }
}
```

You can omit everything. Defaults work for ordinary sessions, and if `model` is unset the memory workers use the current session model.

## Settings reference

Valid `model.thinking` values are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.

Invalid values are ignored. Positive-integer settings must be finite integers greater than zero. `observationsPoolTargetTokens` must also be below `observationsPoolMaxTokens`; if omitted or invalid, it is derived as `Math.floor(observationsPoolMaxTokens / 2)`.

## `observeAfterTokens`

Default: `10000`.

The observer runs from Pi's `turn_end` hook. It counts raw/source tokens after the latest `om.observations.recorded.data.coversUpToId` marker. When the count reaches `observeAfterTokens`, the observer receives source entries after that marker and may append a non-empty `om.observations.recorded` ledger entry.

When Pi reports provider context usage, the observer is also due once the real context has grown by `observeAfterTokens` since the coverage marker (or since the latest compaction, when coverage is behind it). Either measure reaching the threshold launches the observer: the provider delta catches content the character heuristic undercounts, and the raw backlog keeps an observer that fell behind several compactions from starving on a small context window that Pi compacts every few thousand tokens.

Lower values create smaller chunks and more frequent model calls. Higher values reduce model-call frequency but let unobserved raw conversation accumulate longer. If the observer deliberately emits no observations, no ledger entry is written; the same range remains uncovered, and the observer retries after another `observeAfterTokens` of source tokens accumulate.

## `observerChunkMaxTokens`

Default: derived as 20% of the resolved memory model's context window, or `60000` when that window is unavailable.

This caps the source-addressed text sent to one observer run. Complete source entries are added oldest-first while they fit; remaining entries stay eligible for later runs. If the oldest entry alone exceeds the budget, the observer receives a clearly marked head/tail excerpt instead of an over-context request. The original session entry is not modified, and observations still cite its original source id so the source remains traceable in the session ledger.

Set an explicit value when a provider exposes a context window that differs from Pi's model metadata. Values below `256` are clamped to `256` so a chunk can always carry a complete source label, omission marker, and useful context. Keep room for the observer system prompt, prior observations/reflections, tool schemas, and output; setting this equal to the full model window will usually fail.

## `reflectAfterTokens`

Default: `20000`.

The reflector uses this source-token threshold. Reflector progress counts source entries between the latest `om.reflections.recorded.data.coversUpToId` marker and the latest observation coverage marker — material the observer has already turned into observations. Source the observer has not reached yet does not count, so an observer draining a large backlog in small chunks does not trigger a reflector (and dropper) pass after every chunk. When Pi reports provider context usage, real context growth of `reflectAfterTokens` since the marker also makes the reflector due.

The dropper no longer uses `reflectAfterTokens` as its own launch threshold. Dropper work is gated by successful reflection: after the reflector records non-empty reflections in a consolidation pass, the dropper may run if the folded active observation ledger is over `observationsPoolTargetTokens`. It can see same-turn new reflections before deciding what to prune.

Lower values distill reflections more often and therefore create more opportunities for post-reflection dropper maintenance. Higher values reduce reflector model calls but leave more observations between reflection and dropper opportunities.

## `compactAfterTokens`

Default: `81000`.

The auto-compaction trigger runs from Pi's `agent_settled` hook, after retries, automatic compaction, and queued continuation finish. It counts estimated source-entry tokens after the latest compaction boundary **that observation coverage has already reached** — the span a compaction can fold into memory. The count starts at `firstKeptEntryId` when Pi provides that boundary, so retained source entries remain part of the metric, and it stops at the latest observer coverage marker. Memory ledger entries and compaction metadata contribute zero. If the count reaches `compactAfterTokens`, the extension defers with `setTimeout(0)`, checks that Pi is idle, re-checks the same metric, and calls `ctx.compact()`. Pi's provider context usage is not used for this threshold.

Source entries the observer has not reached yet never count toward this threshold, so a session whose observer is slower than the conversation waits for coverage instead of compacting away unobserved context. Without any observation coverage, proactive compaction does not fire at all; Pi's own compaction remains in charge.

This trigger does not wait for observer, reflector, or dropper work. Actual compaction summary creation happens later in `session_before_compact`. A non-empty V3 projection is rendered deterministically and model-free; an empty projection delegates to Pi's native summarizer so prior context is not replaced by an empty summary.

Pi's own window-pressure compaction and manual compaction can still happen independently of this proactive trigger. See [`compactionMaxRetainedTokens`](#compactionmaxretainedtokens) for how the hook protects unobserved context in those cases.

## `compactionMaxRetainedTokens`

Default: derived — `floor(contextWindow * 0.5)` of the active session model, or `60000` when the context window is unknown.

Pi picks the retention boundary (`firstKeptEntryId`) from its own `keepRecentTokens` budget without knowing how far the observer has progressed. When the observer is behind that boundary, every source entry between the observation frontier and Pi's cut would be discarded with no observation describing it. In `session_before_compact` the hook therefore checks for such a gap and, when it finds one:

1. Moves the retention boundary back to the nearest valid cut point at or before the first unobserved entry (that entry itself, or the assistant message whose tool result it is), so those entries stay in context until the observer reaches them. All recorded observations are folded into the summary; a retained entry that already has an observation is redundant, never lost.
2. Checks that the estimated source tokens kept this way, plus the rendered memory summary that replaces the folded range, stay within `compactionMaxRetainedTokens`. If they would exceed it, or if the moved boundary would free nothing, or if the compaction is Pi's context-overflow recovery, the hook declines ownership instead and Pi's native summarizer summarizes the pre-cut context. Keep this budget below Pi's own compaction threshold (`contextWindow - reserveTokens`), otherwise Pi compacts again immediately after a hook-owned compaction.

Set this explicitly when the session model advertises a context window that is much larger than the range it can attend to, or when Pi's `reserveTokens` leaves less than half the window for retained context.

## `observationsPoolMaxTokens`

Default: `20000`.

This controls V3's full-fold pressure. During compaction, the extension builds the normal compaction projection: observations whose `coversUpToId` reaches the compaction boundary, with reflection/drop effects held stable from the latest full fold. If there is no previous full fold, normal compaction includes observations only. If that projection's active observation tokens are at or above `observationsPoolMaxTokens`, compaction performs a full fold through the compaction boundary and applies observations, reflections, and drops by coverage marker. Otherwise, it keeps reflection/drop effects stable from the latest full fold and projects only observations through the new boundary.

This is not the active observation dropper target and not a scheduling threshold for the reflector. Use `observationsPoolTargetTokens` for dropper active observation maintenance and `reflectAfterTokens` for reflector cadence.

## `observationsPoolTargetTokens`

Default: half of `observationsPoolMaxTokens`.

This controls the folded active observation target used by the dropper. If folded active observation tokens are at or below this target, the dropper has no maintenance work. If they are over target, the dropper can run only after the reflector records non-empty reflections in the same consolidation pass.

With the defaults, `observationsPoolMaxTokens` is `20000` and `observationsPoolTargetTokens` is `10000`. If the active observation pool reaches about `20000` tokens, the dropper computes a maximum count intended to move it back toward about `10000` tokens, but the model may drop fewer or none.

When the dropper runs, it computes how many tokens are over target, converts that token excess to an approximate observation-count maximum using average active observation size, and passes that maximum to the model as a hard upper bound. The model may drop fewer or none, and code still rejects invalid or duplicate candidates.

Dropper input includes deterministic reflection coverage evidence for every active observation: `none` means no current reflection supports the observation id, `partial` means one reflection supports it, and `strong` means two or more reflections support it. Coverage is evidence for the model, not an automatic drop rule. Relevance is importance/resistance rather than an absolute lock: `critical` observations require the strongest evidence, but older covered/superseded critical observations may leave active memory when semantic safety is clear. Dropping does not delete ledger history; known ids remain recallable.

This target does not affect compaction full-fold pressure. Visible compaction pressure remains based on `observationsPoolMaxTokens`.

## `agentMaxTurns`

Default: `16`.

This is the shared nested-agent turn cap for the observer, reflector, and dropper. A turn is one assistant/model response cycle inside Pi's agent loop. The cap is not a token budget and not a literal tool-call counter.

Use lower values to bound background memory-worker cost. Too low can reduce observation coverage or reflection/drop quality.

## `agentMaxTokens`

Default: `32000`.

This is the maximum number of output tokens the extension requests for each memory-agent loop (observer, reflector, dropper). It is always clamped to the model's own `maxTokens` when the model advertises one.

Lower it when the memory model is a local server with a modest context window (for example, a llama.cpp server with a 64K slot). Slot KV is shared between the main session's retained cache and concurrent sub-agent requests, so a request whose combined input and response budget exceeds the window fails with `500 "Context size has been exceeded."` and the affected memory run aborts. Pairing a smaller `agentMaxTokens` (e.g. `8192`) with a low `observerChunkMaxTokens` keeps sub-agent requests inside the window.

## `model`

Default: unset, meaning memory workers use the session model.

Set `model` when you want the observer, reflector, and dropper to use a cheaper or faster model than the main coding agent:

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "model": {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "id": "google/gemma-4-31b-it",
      "thinking": "low"
    }
  }
}
```

`provider` and `id` must both be non-empty strings. `thinking` is optional. If the configured model cannot be resolved, the runtime attempts to fall back to the current session model and notifies once. Memory workers accept either an API key or OAuth-style auth headers (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer …`), so OAuth-authenticated providers work without an API key. If no usable model or credentials are available, the relevant background worker skips/fails safely rather than inventing memory.

Workers stream through Pi's composed provider runtime, not `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` alone. Session models whose `api` id comes from `pi.registerProvider` (`cursor-sdk`, CLIProxyAPI, commandcode, and other custom APIs) work without a second built-in provider. `model` remains optional: set it only when you want cheaper/faster workers than the coding agent. Leaving it unset is the Cursor-only setup.

## `compactionSummaryMaxTokens`

Default: derived — `floor(contextWindow / 8)` of the active session model, or `8000` when the context window is unknown.

The rendered memory summary replaces the compacted range in context, so its size decides how much room is left before Pi's next compaction. Without a budget it grows with the ledger: on a long session it reached 17k tokens on a 64k window, more than the context it replaced. The hook reserves at least half of the budget for the newest observations (the chronological record), gives reflections the rest (newest first), lets each side reclaim what the other leaves unused, and ends the summary with a line stating how many older records were omitted. Omitted records stay in the session ledger, count toward the full memory in `/om:status`, and are shown by `/om:view full`.

## `compactionCatchUpMaxChunks`

Default: `2`. Set `0` to disable.

When the background observer is behind Pi's proposed cut, the hook used to either retain the unobserved tail or delegate the whole range to Pi's native summarizer. Both cost headroom: retaining keeps raw source in context, and a native summary is prose that Pi rewrites and grows on every compaction (12k tokens after a hundred rounds on a local model) and that can hit the model's output cap. Instead, when observation coverage exists, the hook now observes the gap synchronously, up to this many observer chunks, appending coverage for each recorded chunk, and then re-resolves the cut, usually landing on Pi's proposed boundary with a bounded summary.

This runs inside `session_before_compact`, where Pi waits for the hook and no session request is in flight, so the memory model does not compete with the session even when both share one server. A chunk that records nothing, fails, or is aborted stops the catch-up; the remaining gap is retained or delegated as before, and nothing is appended for a failed chunk. Catch-up is skipped while a background consolidation run is in flight and when the ledger has no observation coverage at all, so an empty memory still delegates to Pi's native summarizer without a model call.

## `workerMemoryMaxTokens`

Default: derived — `floor(contextWindow / 4)` of the resolved memory model, or `16000` when the context window is unknown.

Each observer, reflector, and dropper request carries prior memory so the worker does not repeat itself and can relate new material to old. The ledger grows without limit on long sessions (107 reflections and 121 active observations, about 45k tokens, on one multi-day session), and sending all of it made every worker request exceed a 64k window, which in turn kept the dropper from ever shrinking the ledger. Worker prompts now carry a bounded slice: observations get at least half the budget and reflections the rest, newest first, each side reclaiming what the other leaves. The dropper receives the oldest observations that fit instead, since pruning old records is its job. With the observer chunk capped at a fifth of the window and `agentMaxTokens` as the output reservation, a worker request stays inside the window.

## `consolidateWhenIdle`

Default: `false`.

By default the observer, reflector, and dropper launch from Pi's `agent_start` and `turn_end` hooks, so they run concurrently with the session's own model calls. That is fine when the memory model has its own capacity. It breaks down when both share one context budget, such as a single local llama.cpp server whose slots draw from one KV pool: a worker request carrying the whole memory plus its output reservation, arriving while the session's request is in flight, exceeds the pool and one side fails with a context-size error — sometimes the session's turn.

With `consolidateWhenIdle: true`:

- Workers launch only from `agent_settled`, after the agent has finished a run and Pi is idle, so their requests never overlap the session's.
- When a new agent run starts while a worker is still running, the run is aborted. Coverage markers are appended only on success, so an aborted run leaves the ledger untouched and retries after the next settled event.
- Proactive compaction is evaluated after the idle run finishes, so it is not starved by memory work sharing the same settled event.

The trade-off is that during a long autonomous tool loop the observer does not advance; the compaction hook still protects unobserved context by retaining it or delegating to Pi's native summarizer (see [`compactionMaxRetainedTokens`](#compactionmaxretainedtokens)). Memory catches up while you type.

## `showWorkerNotifications`

Default: `true`.

When `false`, the extension hides routine observer, reflector, and dropper progress notifications (including deliberate-empty observer info messages). Model fallback/unavailability, worker failures (including observer stream errors), compaction notifications, and explicit `/om:*` command output remain visible.

## `passive`

Default: `false`.

When `true`, the extension does not proactively run the observer, reflector/dropper lane, or auto-compaction trigger. Manual/Pi compaction hooks, `/om:status`, `/om:view`, and `recall` remain available.

Environment override:

```bash
PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE=true pi
```

Truthy values: `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`.

Falsy values: `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`.

Unrecognized values are ignored.

## `debugLog`

Default: `false`.

When enabled, the extension writes best-effort NDJSON debug events under Pi's agent directory. Normal Pi sessions write to a per-session file:

```txt
observational-memory/debug/<session-id>.ndjson
```

Contexts without a usable session id fall back to the legacy global file:

```txt
observational-memory/debug.ndjson
```

Each row includes event metadata such as `sessionId`, `sessionFile`, `runId`, `cwd`, and event-specific `data`. `runId` identifies one consolidation pipeline inside a session file, so you can filter a session log to a single observer/reflector/dropper pass.

Dropper diagnostics are especially useful when the active observation pool is over target but no drops are appended. For example:

```bash
grep '"event":"dropper' ~/.pi/agent/observational-memory/debug/<session-id>.ndjson | tail -n 50
```

Look for `dropper.result`: `no_tool_call` means the model chose not to drop anything, `all_filtered` means proposed ids were unusable, and `selected_nonempty` means usable drops were selected before append handling.

Debug logs are opt-in local debugging artifacts. By default, diagnostic events should record aggregate counts, token totals, ids, file paths, errors, and project details rather than observation/reflection content, prompts, model responses, or raw model-proposed drop ids. Treat debug files as sensitive local artifacts.

Debug-log write failures do not change memory behavior.

## Migrating from V2

V3 is not backwards compatible with V2 settings. Old keys are silently ignored and do not act as aliases.

| V2 setting | V3 setting | Migration note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `observationThresholdTokens` | `observeAfterTokens` | Rename. Same rough observer-cadence role. |
| `compactionThresholdTokens` | `compactAfterTokens` | Rename. Same rough proactive-compaction role. |
| `reflectionThresholdTokens` | `reflectAfterTokens`, `observationsPoolMaxTokens`, and/or `observationsPoolTargetTokens` | Split. Use `reflectAfterTokens` for reflector cadence, `observationsPoolMaxTokens` for compaction full-fold pressure, and `observationsPoolTargetTokens` for dropper active observation maintenance. |
| `compactionModel` | `model` | Move `{ provider, id }` under `model`. |
| `thinkingLevel` | `model.thinking` | Move under `model`. |
| `observerMaxTurnsPerRun` | `agentMaxTurns` | Replace with one shared cap. |
| `reflectorMaxTurnsPerPass` | `agentMaxTurns` | Replace with one shared cap. |
| `prunerMaxTurnsPerPass` | `agentMaxTurns` | Replace with one shared cap; V3 calls the role the dropper. |
| `compactionMaxToolCalls` | none | Remove. No V3 replacement. |
| `passive` | `passive` | Keep if desired. |
| `debugLog` | `debugLog` | Keep if desired. |

Old V2 memory entries and old V2 compaction details are ignored by V3. Start a new clean Pi session after upgrading to V3 so old visible summaries and old memory formats do not confuse the transition.

## Tuning recipes

### Lower background cost

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observeAfterTokens": 20000,
    "reflectAfterTokens": 50000,
    "agentMaxTurns": 8,
    "model": { "provider": "openrouter", "id": "a-cheaper-model", "thinking": "off" }
  }
}
```

Tradeoff: fewer background model calls, but memory updates lag longer, observation chunks are larger, and reflection/drop cleanup happens less often.

### More responsive memory

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "observeAfterTokens": 750,
    "reflectAfterTokens": 3000,
    "agentMaxTurns": 16,
    "model": { "provider": "openrouter", "id": "a-fast-model", "thinking": "low" }
  }
}
```

Tradeoff: more background model calls.

### Disable proactive work temporarily

```json
{
  "observational-memory": {
    "passive": true
  }
}
```

Or for one shell:

```bash
PI_OBSERVATIONAL_MEMORY_PASSIVE=1 pi
```
